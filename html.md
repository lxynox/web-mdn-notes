# HTML

> To build websites, you should know about HTML â€” the fundamental technology used to define the structure of a webpage. HTML is used to specify whether your web content should be recognized as a paragraph, list, heading, link, image, multimedia player, form, or one of many other available elements or even a new element that you define.

## Semantics

HTML5 sections and outlines

1. HTML4 specs is imprecise on `what is a section` and `how its scope is defined`
2. HTML5 `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>` and `<aside>` are always subsections to their nearest ancestor section regardless of internal headings
3. Special sections out of main flow(i.e. advertisement block or explanation box) use `<aside>` element
4. Use `<nav>` for collections of links(i.e. table of contents), `<header>` and `<footer>` for site-related info
